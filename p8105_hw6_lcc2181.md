Loading the packages to complete Homework 6 and adding code to format
for plots.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(modelr)
library(purrr)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
```

## Problem 1

Loading and cleaning data for regression analysis

-   Importing data
-   Converting categorical variables into factors
-   Checking for missing data

``` r
birthweight_df =
  read_csv(file = "./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    malform = as.factor(malform),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace)
  )

birthweight_df %>% 
  is.na.data.frame() %>% 
  sum()
```

    ## [1] 0

Proposing a regression model for birthweight:

-   The model `fit` is based on a hypothesized structured for factors
    associated with birthweight
-   Specifically, the predictors included in the model were based on the
    following factors which may underly birthweight: baby’s sex, baby’s
    length at birth, baby’s head circumference, mother’s age, mother’s
    race, gestational age, and number of cigarettes smoked per day
    during pregnancy

``` r
fit = lm(bwt ~ babysex + blength + bhead + momage + mrace + gaweeks + smoken, data = birthweight_df)
```

Plotting model residuals against fitted values:

``` r
birthweight_df %>% 
  add_predictions(fit) %>% 
  add_residuals(fit) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Fitted Values", y = "Residuals")
```

Comparing model `fit` to two other models in terms of cross-validated
prediction error:

-   `fit_1`: Model using length at birth and gestational age as
    predictors
-   `fit_2`: Model using head circumference, length at birth and sex (as
    well as all interactions between these) as predictors

``` r
cv_df =
  crossv_mc(birthweight_df, 100) %>% 
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    fit = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ babysex + blength + bhead + momage + mrace + gaweeks + smoken, 
          data = .x)),
    fit_1 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    fit_2 = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex + bhead * blength + bhead * babysex 
          + blength * babysex + bhead * blength * babysex, data = .x)),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_fit = map2_dbl(fit, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_fit_1 = map2_dbl(fit_1, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_fit_2 = map2_dbl(fit_2, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y))
  )
```

Plotting distribution of RMSE for each model:

``` r
cv_df %>% 
  select(rmse_fit, rmse_fit_1, rmse_fit_2) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model",
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) +
  geom_violin()
```

<img src="p8105_hw6_lcc2181_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="90%" />

Based on this plot, the model I created (`fit`) performs better than the
other two models (`fit_1` and `fit_2`).
